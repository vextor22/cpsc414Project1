Instructions:

Software requirements: The application requires Java 1.8 with javafx.
		       This has been tested to work with an Oracle Java 1.8 installation, or an
		       OpenJDK 1.8 installation with JavaFX installed on top of OpenJDK.

Compile - use the command "make compile" or just "make". Alertanitively, run javac on
	  ApplicationMain.java

run     - user the command "make run" to run the program, or run java on "ApplicationMain"

Design:

	I chose to have the notification for clicking on the circle be a JavaFX alert message,
	since the Alert class satisfied most of my requirements for a notification by default.
	Utilizing the Alert box and a little bit of added logic, the full requirements for behavior
	of the notification was satisfied.
